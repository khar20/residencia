# Residencia 🏠

**Residencia** is a Flutter-based mobile application designed for landlords and building managers to efficiently manage a local database of tenants (inquilines) and their room registration history.

The app operates entirely offline using a local SQLite database and offers seamless integration with Excel for data migration and reporting.
